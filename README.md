# LINQ Marbles - Interactive diagrams for LINQ

LINQ Marbles is a collection of interactive diagrams for learning and experimenting with LINQ.
It is based on the [Rx Marbles](http://rxmarbles.com/) project, that inspired me to do the same for LINQ and C#.

## Features
- Interactive diagrams for LINQ operators
- In total 30 operators are currently in the collection
- Add items to collections and see the results in real-time!
- Remove items from the collection to see the results (also in real-time)!
- PWA (Progressive Web App) support
